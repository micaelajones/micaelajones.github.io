            <p class="text-muted align-left"> As long as I have been able to write, I have loved it. I enjoy creating stories and find therapy in writing as a way of expressing my feelings whether it’s a journal entry, a blog post, a letter, an essay or a post on social media. Writing also helps bring clarity to my mind when making decisions. Lives are changed and history is created through good writing. To write is to create. In a world that constantly wants us to consume, I would rather take a break from it all and create.</p>

            <h4 class="service-heading">Art</h4>
            <p class="text-muted align-left">Before I could write, I drew. Drawing and painting have been two of my greatest creative outlets. They are also my favorite things to do and an expression of my unique talents. Whenever I paint or draw, I feel joy - the joy of creating something or bringing something to life. It is another way for me to express my feelings. The symbols or illustrations I create often depict my feelings and help me find clarity in my mind.</p>

            <p class="text-muted align-left"> Since I was a little girl, I have been fascinated with Steve Irwin ("The Crocodile Hunter"). He is one of my heroes. His capacity to love and care for all animals, including the ones that people are mostly afraid of (i.e. snakes, spiders, crocodiles), inspired me to want to protect and love animals too. Like him, I feel it is important to be guided by our passion instead of our fears, and to conserve natural habitats and resources on this planet for future generations.</p>

                     I was born and raised in Nuevo Casas Grandes, Chihuahua - a small town in northern Mexico. At the age of five, I was diagnosed with high functioning autism/autism spectrum disorder, which changed my life and the life of my family a lot. It was a big challenge for all of us to live with because of the unusual behaviors that I had as a little girl with autism. Additionally, there were the hardships of making friends and fitting in with my peer group, and trying to learn or think in ways that seemed contrary to my nature.

                <p class="large text-muted">
                    I moved to northern California to live with my sister and her husband when I was 14 due to the drug violence that was taking place in Mexico, especially the town I grew up in. Though it was a big change for me as a 14-year-old girl, I adjusted quickly to living in the United States and was able to further develop my communication and learning skills, because of the accommodations I received in California. 
                </p>
                <p class="large text-muted">
                    With the help of some wonderful teachers and administrators, I achieved more than I could have hoped while living there and was put on a path that would change the rest of my life. During my freshman year at Rancho Cotate High School, I received an award for earning a 4.0 GPA. The following year—my sophomore year—I earned a place on the Principal’s list and lettered. 
                </p>
                <p class="large text-muted">
                    Two years after I moved to California, I moved with my parents to Utah where I finished my last two years of high school, graduating with honors and receiving an award for my outstanding performance as a dedicated student at Timpview High School.

                <p class="large text-muted">
                   In Fall 2012, I started college at Brigham Young University – Idaho, my first choice university. It was a bigger change for me since I was away from home, my family and I was living in a place that was not familiar to me. The classes I took at BYU-Idaho were more challenging and advanced for me because I was at another level. In time, I adjusted to living in Rexburg, Idaho like I adjusted to living in California and Utah. I was able to understand the material that my professors were teaching and I performed well in my classes.
                </p>
                <p class="large text-muted">
                  As a reward for my hard work, I received an Associate of Science in General Studies in Fall 2014. Two years later, in July 2017, I received a Bachelor of Arts in English-Creative Writing, my chosen major. Looking back at how much I have accomplished in my life, I realize that it is possible to overcome the challenges that I face with hard work and determination. Now that I have graduated from college, I am determined to become a successful writer and artist, my chosen careers.

                  <h2>Eloise, The Black Sheep</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted"></p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/black-sheep.jpg" alt="">
                  <div class="align-left">    
                      <p>On a green, grassy field not far away, there lived a kind shepherd. Every day, morning and night, he would spend most of his time with a flock of sheep. Great or small, he took care of them. He would feed them, bathe them, and help them. He kept his sheep together all the time and would lead them to the good places in the field. By his side was Bentley, the loyal sheepdog. Whenever his master was away, Bentley would look out for the flock and protect them from any danger.</p>
                      <p>Among the shepherd’s sheep, there lived one called Eloise. Like every sheep in the flock, she was as white as snow. Since she was little, she would play with her friends, Leah and Abigail. They enjoyed jumping over fences. Sometimes Abigail would say, “That fence is too high to jump over!” But, Eloise was a very brave sheep. She would fly over and make it through.</p>  
                      <p>But, there was a special kind of fence that the Shepherd built for his sheep. It was incredibly high for any animal to jump over, especially a little lamb. On the other side of the fence, there was a forest with lots of leaves and trees. Because she had never been there, Eloise wanted to explore the forest. But, Leah and Bentley stood in front of her and stopped her. Bentley said, “You must not go over the fence and into the forest, Eloise!” She didn’t understand and asked, “Well, why not?” Firm and gentle, Leah explained, “The Shepherd said that we shouldn’t go in there because we could get lost and may never find our way back.” Eloise still wanted to go into the forest, but she couldn’t bear the thought of disobeying the shepherd. The two sheep went back to the flock.</p>    
                      <p>When the following day came, the forest was all that Eloise could think of. She was distracted so much that she went over to the fence. Making sure that no one was around, Eloise jumped over. When she entered the forest, there were beautiful sunflowers and blooming roses. The little sheep was amazed.</p>    
                      <p>Feeling thirsty, she came upon an enormous water hole. A black pig was also drinking from there. </p>    
                      <p>“May I drink from this water?” she asked. </p>    
                      <p>“Oh, sure! You may drink as much water as you like,” he replied. “I like to come here a lot! There’s more water than at home,” he added. Eloise bowed her head and opened her mouth to drink the water. The cool drink satisfied her dry, itchy throat.</p>    
                      <p>She went to the pig and asked him, “Excuse me, Mr. Pig, but is there any danger in this forest?” </p>    
                      <p>He looked at her in surprise and said, “What danger? Why would you think something silly like that?”</p>    
                      <p>“My friends have told me that the forest is not safe for everyone,” she replied.</p>    
                      <p>The pig laughed, “Well, I never saw any danger in here. When I came to this forest, nothing bad happened to me, so I say it’s safe!”</p>    
                      <p>“Have you always lived here, Mr. Pig?”</p>    
                      <p>“No, I lived with an old farmer and other pigs.”</p>    
                      <p>“Do you miss them?”</p>
                      <p>“My friends, yes. The farmer, no. He gave too many rules to us and they weren’t very fair.” This made Eloise think about her life with the Shepherd and the other sheep. “The Shepherd did make some rules that I thought were too unfair,” she thought, “Maybe, it’s better for me that I stay here. This place isn’t so bad! After all, there’s more water and shade under the trees and I don’t have to walk a lot to get water.”</p>  
                      <p>When it was nighttime, Eloise laid herself under a tree in the forest. She asked Mr. Pig if he would lie next to her so that she would be less afraid of the dark, but he told her not to worry. “If you need anything, I will be by the water hole,” He promised her, “Goodnight, Eloise!”</p>    
                      <p>“Goodnight, Mr. Pig,” she replied and watched him blend in with the darkness. That night, Eloise had a hard time sleeping. The roots she was lying on were very hard and bumpy, and it was very dark, pitch black. She couldn’t see the moon or the stars. She also heard other noises that she couldn’t figure out. Because it was so dark, she became afraid. “Don’t worry, Eloise. You’re safe under the tree. There’s nothing to be afraid of,” she said to herself. But, the noises grew louder. The louder they got, the more scared she got. She closed her eyes and covered her ears, constantly thinking of happy thoughts that came to her mind until she fell asleep.</p>    
                      <p>But when morning came, Eloise wasn’t feeling very well. Her legs felt so sore from sleeping on the roots that she had a hard time walking. Her eyes were still very sleepy and heavy. They closed while she was walking to the water hole. But when she looked at her reflection in the water, Eloise was in shock. Her soft wool was no longer white like the other sheep. It turned black like coal.</p>    
                      <p>“What happened to me?” she cried out. “Why did I turn black?”</p>    
                      <p>“It happened when you were asleep, Eloise,” Mr. Pig told her. “When it was nighttime and you fell asleep, you turned black like I did.” Feeling sad and heartbroken, the black sheep cried out, “But I don’t want to be this way! I like the way I was before!”</p>    
                      <p>“I’m sorry to tell you, Eloise, but you are and you will be like this for the rest of your life,” Mr. Pig said to her. This made her mad. “I’m going home!” she angrily told the pig. But he stopped in front of her and said, “You can’t go home, little sheep. When you’ve changed, there’s nowhere else to go. The only place you’re welcomed to is here.” Shocked & disappointed, Eloise cried.</p>    
                      <p>“What’s the problem?” an unfamiliar voice asked. The black sheep looked up and saw a wolf. He was dark and larger than Eloise. His eyes were golden yellow and his mouth was opened with drool falling out and his sharp teeth showing. The black sheep turned from being heartbroken to afraid. She knew that she wasn’t supposed to be anywhere near a hungry wolf. </p>    
                      <p>“I don’t like to be black,” she muttered.</p>    
                      <p>“And why’s that?” the wolf asked with a deep, scratchy voice.</p>    
                      <p>“Because I like being white more,” Eloise courageously replied.</p>    
                      <p>“Sometimes, black can be more suiting than white. You can do whatever you want with it and not worry about any problems,” the terrifying wolf tried to convince her to believe him. But, her thoughts changed back to the Shepherd and the flock.</p>    
                      <p>“I also miss my family,” she announced to him. This bugged the wolf even more and he started to get a little meaner. “Well, your Shepherd and your family won’t want you back anymore. You left them and you belong here. This is your home now and forever.”</p> 
                      <p>Eloise grew even more afraid. She realized that she couldn’t stay now that the wolf was in her way. It was time for her to leave.</p>  
                      <p>“You are a mean and hungry wolf! I do not want to see you again! If I stay, you will eat me!” After she said that, the little black sheep dashed off in less than a heartbeat. The wolf started running after her. Eloise ran and ran as fast as she could. “You’ll never get away from me, little sheep! You are mine forever!” he called out to her. They sped through the forest. Eloise grew tired and thirsty, but her fear of the wolf was greater than her being tired. She ran faster than that wolf could. “I’ve got to keep running or that wolf will eat me alive!” she thought.</p>    
                      <p>When she got out of the forest, she hurried up the hill. But, there was the high fence. Would Eloise have the strength to jump over it? She knew she could! With a deep breath of courage and confidence, she aimed for the high fence. When she reached it, she leapt and flew over.</p>    
                      <p>As soon as she landed on the other side of the fence, Eloise noticed that the wolf couldn’t jump over. It was much too high for him and he was very tired. The little black sheep knew that she was safe. The wolf couldn’t hurt her anymore. He had anger in his yellow eyes, but he turned around and went back into the forest, never to be seen again.</p>    
                      <p>When her head turned to another way, she saw a pair of human feet in sandals. She looked up and realized whose feet they were. It was the kind and loving Shepherd. He smiled at her, but the little sheep didn’t. She looked back down at the ground, feeling sorry and ashamed for disobeying the Shepherd’s rules.</p>  
                      <p>“Eloise,” he softly spoke her name, “I am so happy to have you back home.” She grew confused.</p>    
                      <p>“But, how can you be happy? I disobeyed you. I am now a black sheep and I’ll never be white again. Please send me away,” she cried out her guilt with tears in her eyes. The Shepherd put his hand on her head and said, “Eloise, don’t ever despair. No matter how black you become, you will always be one of my sheep.” The little sheep embraced the Shepherd and walked home with him.</p>    
                      <p>When they returned home, every one of the sheep was happy to have Eloise back, including Leah, Abigail. As the Good Shepherd always did, he fed Eloise, bathed her and helped her. He took her to the river by the field and washed all of the black color off of her wool with a clean wet sponge. The sponge sucked the black into itself and was squeezed to release the dark color out into the river, letting it flow away. As soon as he finished, Eloise was white again. She felt truly happy and clean as she did before.</p>    
                      <p>From then on, Eloise stayed by the flock for the rest of her life. She never went over the fence again, but stayed with the Good Shepherd. There was a happiness that never ended in the green grassy field.</p>

                  <p class="align-left">Although a few days have passed the 16th anniversary, this is a sketch that I started and completed in honor of the 9/11 victims and their families. In this picture as you can see, a woman is crying at the memorial with an angel by her side, resting his hand on her shoulder because he, as a messenger and servant of God, shares her pain. As I had been remembering the event since the 16th anniversary passed, I had a thought to myself, "There is no doubt that a lot of people had this question in their minds, 'Where was God when this happened?'" Then the next thought that occurred was, "I was there." I drew this sketch not only as a tribute, but as a message that God is always there, and so are His angels. </p>

                  <h2>Beauty and The Beast: A Retold Fairy Tale</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Sneak Peek</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/castle.jpg" alt="">
                  <div class="align-left">    
                      <p>After walking through the dense coats of snow on the ground, Felicity spotted a strange pillar pointing to the pomegranate-colored sky.</p>  
                      <p>“How strange! Is that a castle or something?” She thought as she took giant steps across the snow. Her legs burned from the heavy thickness of snow, but it brought warmth to her body. Soon, her legs felt lighter when there was less snow before noticing a bridge across a river surrounding the tall building.</p>   
                      <p>However, she still walked slowly, hesitant to seek an opportunity to help her family. Was sacrificing something precious the right thing to do? She stopped and almost turned around, but her family’s life was more valuable than her own.</p>    
                      <p class="italic">Crackle… Crackle… Crackle… </p>    
                      <p>Each snowflake was crushed all the way to the door. Felicity let out her freezing clenched hand to knock hard on the door until a voice broke through the cold silence, “What are you doing here on my property?”</p>    
                      <p>She gasped. The shadow she saw didn’t have the bottom of his feet touching the ground. He was a dark ghost in her eyes the minute she saw him. Everything about him had fit what Felicity’s father said about him. She could not identify every detail, for he was a mystery as her father said. She could only see that he had a round head and a long cloak around him. Who was this man? Was he really human? Or was he a ghost?</p>    
                      <p>“Are you Lord Magnus?” Felicity mumbled.</p>    
                      <p>“Who are you?”</p>    
                      <p>“My name is Felicity. I’ve come here on behalf of my father.”</p>    
                      <p>“I know who your father is. It is him I want, not you!”</p>    
                      <p>“But you have to understand, Sir! My family relies on him greatly for his support and protection.”</p>    
                      <p>“Then, have your mother do the work.”</p>    
                      <p>“My mother died years ago.”</p> 
                      <p>They were silent for a moment until Lord Magnus asked, “Why did you come?”</p>  
                      <p>“To beg you for mercy on my father. Stealing and killing your deer was wrong, but he only did it because we were starving to death.”</p>    
                      <p>“It’s probably best that you did instead of stealing from me.”</p>    
                      <p>“You have no compassion in your heart, do you? Did you ever have a family desperate enough that you would do anything for them, even if it meant stealing?”</p> 
                      <p>“You’re wasting your time, Miss.”</p>    
                      <p>“Please, Lord Magnus. Don’t take my father away from us. We already lost our mother,” Felicity’s knees fell to the snow.</p>    
                      <p>“I also came with an offer, perhaps better than my father working for you,” she said.</p>    
                      <p>“And what is it you’re offering?” Lord Magnus asked.</p>    
                      <p>“Take me in as your servant, and I will pay the debt no matter how long it takes. I am young and strong enough to work, and I will obey every order you give me.”</p>    
                      <p>“Every order?”</p>    
                      <p>“Yes.”</p>    
                      <p>“Are you willing to sacrifice your own freedom over your father’s?”</p>    
                      <p>“Yes,” Felicity’s eyes welled up with tears, “Even my own life.”</p>
                      <p>“You do realize that once you become my servant, you will never see your family again?”</p>    
                      <p>Felicity’s throat hurt to swallow with a big lump inside. One of her teardrops fell into the snow and soaked in.</p>    
                      <p>“I recognize all risks,” she said, “And I’m willing to take them for my family’s future.”</p>    
                      <p>“Then look into my eyes and swear to me that you will obey my every order. You will not leave this castle unless you are permitted, and have paid me in return,” the dark shadow commanded. Felicity looked into his shadowed face with eyes of heartbreak and fear.</p>    
                      <p>“You have my word.”</p>
